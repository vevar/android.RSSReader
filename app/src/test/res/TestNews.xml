                A green sea turtle trapped in a gill net. Scientists estimate the global green
                turtle population has declined 50 to 70 percent since 1900.

                An organization on the coast of Kenya tries to persuade local residents to help
                return the trapped reptiles to the ocean, rather than sell their meat and shells for
                a living.
